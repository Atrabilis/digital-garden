# ðŸŒ± Digital garden

This is my digital garden, an excuse to learn Jekyll, Github pages and Github Actions. 
It is also a place where i practice my technical writing and English by forcing myself to write everithing i study, a habit that i have not developed. 
This site can be a reference where me (or you), or you can fork this repo and make your own garden too. Regardless, it will be growing over time.
